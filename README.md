# insurance_policy_prediction
# This is my machine learning project, during the training.
# Project Overview: 
Mail or not to mail. Direct mailing the potetial customers. As we know many type of customers not interested to buy that policy. Help of machine learning, we can filter that which type of customers take the this policy or not. using the machine learning, we can save the our time and money, becuase when a company mail the customers, they are spent the lot of money and time and using the Machine learning we can just mail those cutomers which is interested in this policy this is good for commpany and eommployee and we can save our time and money.
# What I did
In this project, there is a not any nan value,so it is very easy to me solve this problem. I have used some featuring engineering to know which is the best variable for the machine learning. and I have used logistic regression which have i checked the multicorrelinearity using the seaborn library and used normal distribution and correlation between dependent or independent variable.
